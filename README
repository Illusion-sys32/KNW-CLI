  - **Add `JAVA_HOME` to your system’s PATH** (see detailed steps below)

### Android Studio & ADB Emulator

- **Android Studio:** Required for Android development
- **ADB Emulator:** Make sure you have an ADB emulator installed and configured
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Set up `ANDROID_SDK` and any other necessary environment variables as per your development needs

### Development Environment Setup

While you can use any code editor, it is **strongly recommended** to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) due to its robust ecosystem. To optimize your VS Code experience, install the following extensions:

- **Gradle Extension:** (optional but helpful)
- **Java Extension Pack:** Provides essential Java development tools
- **Prettier:** For consistent code formatting
- **ESLint:** To maintain code quality and style  
*(Feel free to add any other popular extensions that suit your workflow)*
